## Overview
Personal Dashboard is a Chrome extension designed to replace the default new tab page with a customizable and visually appealing interface. This extension features stunning background images sourced from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers), which refreshes with each new tab. It also displays the current time and weather conditions based on the user's location, ensuring relevant and up-to-date information. Additionally, Personal Dashboard delights users with adorable dog images from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), offering a new cute dog photo with every page refresh.

I developed this Chrome extension to practice my skills in fetching data from APIs and developing and deploying Chrome extensions.
